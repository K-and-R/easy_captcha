# Many of the defaults used by Markdownlint are chosen because of how renderers
# interpret Markdown. The defaults are chosen for the greatest compatability and
# confidence in proper rendering of the Markdown; for text-only viewing, it is
# less relevant.

# Enabled all rules
#
# This is makes many of the rules defined below, where they are just being
# enabled and running with the defaults, unnecessary. They've been left in for
# explanatory purposes.
